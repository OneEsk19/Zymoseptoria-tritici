## Plotting both ISH and both CLR together

Loading all four multi-plots need to be loaded into environment from IHS_plots_PRE.Rmd, IHS_plots_POST.Rmd, CLR_plots_PRE.Rmd, CLR_plots_POST.Rmd

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
```

```{r}
compound <- grid.arrange(preplotCLR, preplotIHS, postplotCLR, postplotIHS, ncol=1)
```
```{r}
ggsave(filename = "./IMGS/compound_CLR_IHS.png", plot = compound, device = "png", width = 50, height = 20, units = "cm")
```
