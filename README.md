## Contents

### Folders:
* IMGS
  - Various plots and images generated by different pipelines

* data_sheets
  - all source metadata
  - generated subsets and tables written to file (final versions)

### Files:
* AUS350.Rmd
  - Pipeline for making the VCF that include drought populations and exclude Hamilton cluster

* Activity_log
  - Week to week goals and actions

* Dissecting VCF files
  - Document i made a while ago detailing the typical contents of a vcf file

* Generalised_VCF_filter_PCA.rmd
  - Subsetting AUS isolates from population
  - Applying folters
  - PCA to indicate clustering of isolates
  - SNP subsetting to reduce dimension
  - PCA of a different subset (describe this better when you understand it)
  - Combine isolates subset with phenotype data and make PCA

* Mapping.rmd
  - Plotting where are our samples are from and thier relative sample size

* Notes.md
  - Notes, reminders, correspondence. Stuff i might need to remember.

* PlotFilteredSNPs.rmd
  - PLots of various quality metrics from the filtered VCF of all isolates
    - From GATK pipeline which combined invidicual VCFs into one large VCF

* Run_filter_may2020.sh
  - GATK pipeline

* WGS_survey_maps_megan.R
  - Megan's map plot as a baseline to work from

* amendingfile.R
  - script that modified GATK output VCF
  - used in PlotFilteredSNPs.rmd

* drought_status_pop.Rmd
  - pipeline for indicating drought status per isolate and re-ordering the VCF file accordingly

* metadata_wrangling
  - various bits and bobs to aid with my understanding of the dataset

* pcadapt_first_try.Rmd
  - First attempt at using this package.
  - Ran into problems
  - Retained this file simply to document problems encountered.

* pcadapt_workflow.Rmd
  - Using package pcadapt to perform genome scans for selection based on principal component analysis 
  - refs: https://bcm-uga.github.io/pcadapt/articles/pcadapt.html , https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12592

* pheno_data
  - playing around with the phenotyped samples

* preparation_for_pcadapt.Rmd
  - assigning population group identifiers to samples as ordered in VCF

* readabe_pcadapt.md
  - as  pcadapt.Rmd, but more readable here.

* readformat_VCF_FILTER_PCA_commented_G.md
  - this is the "Generalised_VCF_filter_PCA" modified and commented by me
  - in a nice readable format that displays well on github

* snp_matrix
  - workflow for producing and labelling a snp matrix
