## Week to week goals and actions

#### Week 1: 5th - 10th May

Goals:  
1) Summary of isolates and maybe a draft map showing their location.  
2) Basic understanding of VCF filtering and getting rid of low quality SNPs and low quality individuals.  

Actions:
- Completed goal 2
- Exploring metadata
- Completed goal 1

Questions:
See rmd


#### Week 2: 11th - 18th May

Goals:
1) Continue to explore the data
2) Consider which populations to use
3) Look into FST, particularly sliding window FST

Actions:
1) Completed VCF subset to include drought populations and exclude the Hamilton+ cluster (as seen on PCA)
2) Made SNP matrix, ran into dfficulties using it, temporarily ignoring this
3) Tried some sliding window FST pipelines, ran into problems

#### Week 3: 18th - 24th May

Goals:
1) Continue to work on SW FST, see what I can get working.
